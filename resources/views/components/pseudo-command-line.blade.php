        pJanks>$ Hello friends, I am a software developer, presently based out of Las Vegas, NV, USA. When I began learning about software a few years ago, I started with a frontend emphasis, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JS, and then, later, building jQuery and React on top of those skills. I have since layered on backend knowledge, developing end-to-end apps. I am most comfortable with a LAMP stack right now, but I have experience with NoSQL databases as well, and I'm always looking to gain knowledge on unfamiliar concepts and to continue adding tools to my toolbox. I enjoy the challenges that coding presents and I am often guilty of delving deep into rabbit holes trying to understand why things behave the way they do, especially across different programming languages. Currently, I am setting my ambitions on cyber security and ethical hacking. I'm excited for the what the future holds! If you'd like to chat, feel free to send me an email at the link listed above, and make sure to check out some of the other features on the site!!<span class="yellow-command-line-text"> happy-hacking </span><span class="grey-command-line-text">--save-dev</span>
